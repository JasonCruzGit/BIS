## 💬 Common Questions & Answers

### **Q: How much does it cost?**
**A:** "We have three plans starting at ₱15,000 per year. That's less than ₱1,300 per month - less than what most barangays spend on paper and printing. The ROI is typically 3-4 months. Would you like to see which plan fits your barangay?"

### **Q: Is it difficult to learn?**
**A:** "Not at all! The system is designed to be intuitive. We provide comprehensive training, and most staff members are comfortable within a week. We also offer ongoing support and video tutorials."

### **Q: What if we're a small barangay?**
**A:** "Perfect! Our Starter plan is designed for smaller barangays. It's affordable and includes all core features. As you grow, you can easily upgrade. Many small barangays start with this plan."

### **Q: How long does implementation take?**
**A:** "Typically 2-3 weeks. Week 1 is setup and configuration, Week 2 is data migration, and Week 3 is training. We handle everything, so you don't need to worry about technical details."

### **Q: What about data security?**
**A:** "Security is our top priority. We use bank-level encryption, regular backups, role-based access control, and complete audit trails. We're also compliant with Philippine Data Privacy Act."

### **Q: Can residents really use it online?**
**A:** "Absolutely! Residents can create accounts, request documents, file complaints, and track status - all from their phone or computer, 24/7. No need to visit the barangay hall for simple requests."

### **Q: What if we already have a system?**
**A:** "Great! We can help you migrate your data. BIS offers more features, better user experience, and ongoing support. Many of our clients switched from other systems. We offer migration assistance at no extra cost."

- Admin training (4 hours)
- Staff training (2 hours)
- User manuals
- Video tutorials

## 🎯 Objection Handling

### **"It's too expensive"**
**Response:**
"I understand budget is a concern. Let me show you the ROI:
- Current costs: Paper, printing, storage, time = ₱20,000-30,000/year
- BIS cost: ₱15,000/year
- Time savings: 80% = equivalent to 1-2 staff members
- Break-even: 3-4 months

Plus, you get better service, happier residents, and modern technology. Would you like to see a detailed cost analysis?"

---

### **"Our staff won't adapt"**
**Response:**
"I hear this concern often, but here's what happens:
- The system is designed to be intuitive
- We provide comprehensive training
- Most staff are comfortable within a week
- We offer ongoing support

We've never had a barangay where staff couldn't adapt. In fact, most staff love it because it makes their job easier. Would you like to see a demo to judge for yourself?"

---

### **"We're too small"**
**Response:**
"Actually, smaller barangays benefit the most! Here's why:
- Starter plan is very affordable (₱15,000/year)
- You get the same powerful features
- Less data to migrate
- Faster implementation
- Better service with fewer staff

Many small barangays use BIS and love it. Size doesn't matter - efficiency does!"

---

### **"We need to think about it"**
**Response:**
"Of course! Here's what I'll do:
1. Send you a detailed proposal
2. Schedule a follow-up call next week
3. Offer an extended trial period

In the meantime, you can start a free 30-day trial - no commitment, no credit card. You can explore all features risk-free. When would be a good time to follow up?"

---

### **"We already have a system"**
**Response:**
"That's great! Many of our clients switched from other systems. Here's why they made the switch:
- Better user experience
- More features
- Better support
- Regular updates
- Modern technology

We can help you migrate your data at no extra cost. Would you like to see a comparison or try our system side-by-side?"

---

### **"We don't have the budget right now"**
**Response:**
"I understand. Here are some options:
1. **Payment plans** - Spread the cost over 12 months
2. **Start with Starter plan** - Upgrade later when budget allows
3. **Free trial** - Try it for 30 days, see the value, then decide
4. **ROI analysis** - I can show you how it pays for itself

Many barangays find that the savings from reduced paper, printing, and time more than cover the cost. Would you like to see a detailed ROI calculation?"
